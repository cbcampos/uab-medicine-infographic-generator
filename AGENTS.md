# Agent Instructions

Use this file as the entry point for project-level coding rules.

## Rule Review Requirement
Before implementing changes, review all markdown rule files under `.kilocode/rules/`:

1. `.kilocode/rules/coding_standard.md`
2. `.kilocode/rules/documentation_style.md`
3. `.kilocode/rules/formatting.md`
4. `.kilocode/rules/naming_conventions.md`
5. `.kilocode/rules/security_guidelines.md`
6. `.kilocode/rules/restricted_files.md`
7. `.kilocode/rules/llm_utils_guide.md`

## Operational Policy

1. Follow the rules above as authoritative project instructions.
2. Prefer reuse from `llm_utils/aiweb_common` before adding new utilities.
3. Keep generated and committed code compliant with formatting and naming rules.
4. Do not read, write, or commit restricted files listed in `.kilocode/rules/restricted_files.md`.
5. Never expose PHI, credentials, keys, or other secrets in logs, code, docs, or commits.
